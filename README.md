# space visualizer
classify the star types using its images and even it's dimensions, visualize space and galaxies

## 1. Introduction:
The model automatically assigning an image to a specific category based on its content. This script likely explores various techniques to achieve this goal, potentially including:
- Data preprocessing: Preparing the image data for model training, which could involve tasks like resizing, normalization, or feature extraction.
- Model building and training: Creating and training machine learning models on the prepared data. This might involve decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), or potentially even convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained models on unseen data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## 2. Setting Up the Environment:
- Instructions on installing necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch).
- Importing the required libraries within the script.

## 3. Data Preprocessing:
- *Star Catalogue Dataset:*
  - Loading the CSV data containing star information.
  - Handling missing values (if any).
  - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., star type, spectral class).
  - Applying dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) for visualization.
- *Galaxy10 Dataset:*
  - Loading the galaxy image dataset.
  - Resizing and normalizing the images.
  - Extracting features using techniques like HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients).

## 4. Model Building and Training:
- *Star Catalogue Classification:*
  - Training a decision tree model for star type classification.
  - Training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for the same task.
  - Hyperparameter tuning for both models (optional).
- *Galaxy10 Classification:*
  - Training an SVM model with the extracted HOG features.
  - Training a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a neural network for classification.
  - Comparing the performance of SVM and MLP.

## 5. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluating the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Visualizing the results using confusion matrices.

## 6. Convolutional Neural Networks:
- Introduction to CNN architecture and its components (convolutional layers, pooling layers, activation functions).
- Brief demonstration of training a CNN on image data (potentially Hymenoptera dataset for classifying bees/ants).

## 7. Conclusion:
- The script empowers researchers to classify various image datasets. This could be used in astronomy for star type classification, as hinted at in the script, or in biology for classifying cell types under a microscope.
- By automatically classifying images, it can save time and effort when sorting through large photo collections.

## 8. Future Scope:
- Exploring more advanced deep learning architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) for improved performance.
- Experimenting with different feature extraction techniques for various image datasets.
- Implementing transfer learning with pre-trained models for faster training.
- Deploying the trained model for real-world applications (e.g., image classification web service).
- Explore ways to collect more diverse data to improve model generalization and consider data augmentation techniques to artificially expand the dataset.
